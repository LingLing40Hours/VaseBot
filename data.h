//COORDINATES

//x = 80*col - 40, where col starts from 1
//squash trigger interval [-20, 95]
//regular zombie hitbox [36, 78]
//screen (0, 0) is (-40, 80) in mem
//for plants, (x+40, y+40) is used for collision detection
//for decimal coordinates, use (int)() part of value

//NOTES
//if 2+ zombies are touching snow pea, which one will get slown? see stack theory
